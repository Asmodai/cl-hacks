                               CL-HACKS

The CL-HACKS package is a port of Kevin M. Rosenberg's KMRCL,
Alexandria, parts of CLOCC and various other packages assembled
together in one place and expanded upon so they work on Symbolics
Genera.

Parts of Zetalisp, Symbolics Common Lisp, and Future Common Lisp have
been thrown in for good measure too.


                            PACKAGE LAYOUT

CL-HACKS has five separate packages, but only one that the user need
worry about.  These packages are:

CL-HACKS-INTERNALS  Contains extensions to Lisp that are required for
                    the rest of the CL-HACKS packages to function.  I
                    have placed these in their own package to ensure
                    that they are available and not accidentally
                    broken during careless edits.
                    
CL-HACKS-FAD        A port of Dr. Edi Weitz' CL-FAD for Symbolics
                    Genera.

CL-HACKS-MOP        Contains MOP extensions.

CL-HACKS-CLOS       Contains various CLOS extensions.

CL-HACKS            The main package.


There is a UUID package that is meant to be used on Genera only.  For
other Common Lisp systems, it is recommended that you use the
following instead:
